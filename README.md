# xpandoc

A script wrapper of pandoc with custom template.

This is stealed from [pandoc_md](https://github.com/hh123okbb/dotfiles/tree/master/markdown/pandoc),
 but added some improvements and support convert to PDF.

- Read [xpandoc](./xpandoc.sh) for `usage`.
- Read [pandoc official doc](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html) to understand pandoc.
